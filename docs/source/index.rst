Ray Culp's Unofficial LibreOffice Basic Reference
=================================================

Why this documentation?
-----------------------

This documentation project has two goals:

- To **fully** document the LibreOffice Basic programming language and the LibreOffice API *from the perspective of the Basic language*.
- To help VBA programmers who are interested in learning how to extend the functionality of LibreOffice using Basic. 

This documentation is inspired by the outstanding `Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/>`_. 

.. note::

   As of 2024-07-03, this project is still a work-in-progress and extremely incomplete.
