Ray Culp's Unofficial LibreOffice Basic Reference
=================================================

.. note::

   This project is still a work-in-progress and extremely incomplete.

Purpose of this documentation
-----------------------------

This documentation project has two goals:

- To **fully** document the `LibreOffice <https://www.libreoffice.org/>`_ Basic programming language and the LibreOffice API **from the perspective of a Basic programmer**.
- To help programmers familiar with Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to get started with LibreOffice Basic. 

Scope
-----

This documentation project currently focuses exclusively on the LibreOffice API and the LibreOffice version of the Basic programming language. No other APIs or programming languages are covered.

While it is true that the OpenOffice API is very similar to the LibreOffice API, and much of this documentation is likely applicable to both, small differences have crept in since LibreOffice branched off from OpenOffice. For this reason, readers should not expect compatibility.

This documentation is inspired by the outstanding `Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/>`_. Microsoft's business practices may suck, but its documentation rocks.
